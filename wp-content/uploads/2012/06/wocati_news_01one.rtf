In its most immediate and\par concrete forms theological education is shaped by the religious,\par educational, social, political and historical traditions\par within which it exists. Theological education is carried out in\par a world which is increasingly being made aware of its interdependence\par and religious pluralism. Its context is both local\par and global and therefore, it can function more effectively\par within a worldwide framework.\par These characteristics of theological education have led\par theological institutions to commit themselves to closer cooperation\par at local, national, and regional levels. It is appropriate\par that a global network and organization be established to serve,\par support, and enhance theological education in its constituent\par parts. To this end, the World Conference of Associations of\par Theological Institutions is established. The members constituting\par this Conference join themselves together for the purpose\par of advancing their shared vision, purpose, and common cause.\par }{\b\fs28 WOCATI PURPOSES\par }{\i\f0 Executive Committee members are (from left) Jaci Maraschin\par (ASTE, Brazil), Teresia Hinga (ATIEA, Kenya), Barbara Brown\par Zikmund (ATS, USA), Yeow Choo-Lak (ATESEA, Singapore),\par Diane Jagdeo (CATS, West Indies), and Ian Williams (ANZATS,\par Australia).

Twenty-six\par delegates from sixteen member associations, together with two\par consultants and thirteen guests participated. The Congress was\par able to further the goals of WOCATI as affirmed in the\par constitution adopted at the inaugural meeting at Kaliurang,\par Jogyakarta, Indonesia in June, 1989. During the first two days,\par the WOCATI Congress shared in joint sessions with The\par Association of Theological Schools in the United States and\par Canada (ATS) at its biennial meeting.\par At the Congress, the following were amongst the most\par significant themes discussed:\par (a) The inter-relationship between globalization and\par contextualization. The importance of globalization was recognized\par in providing a broad, indeed global perspective for the\par theological task and also challenging any particular theology\par which claims to be universal. However, with a significant\par number of delegates representing associations from the southern\par regions of the world, questions were raised as to whether\par some expressions of globalization could be another form of the\par continuing dominance of the concerns of northern theology. A\par global perspective needs to acknowledge the range and diversity\par of cultural contexts in which theology and theological\par education are pursued. It was recognized that a crucial challenge\par to theological educators in many regions of the world\par was to give greater attention to developing forms of contextual\par theology. Some of these contextual theologies are being\par developed in regions of considerable religious pluralism. This\par constitutes a significant challenge to many traditional ways of\par doing theology.\par (b) Who defines excellence of theological scholarship? In the\par discussions at the Congress, great emphasis was placed upon\par the task of theological educators to educate the whole people\par of God. To engage in this task means to develop new forms of\par theological scholarship and research, with different criteria for\par evaluating excellence. Theologies of the people are not to be\par uncritical. However, at present, there tends to be a dominance\par of, if not an enslavement to, norms of excellence as defined by\par the academy and professional and disciplinary guilds, especially\par those of the northern world. The Congress asked the\par executive committee of WOCATI to be responsible for a\par continuing study of ways in which theological education and\par excellence of theological scholarship are being defined and\par developed in the various regions of the world.\par (c) The contributions of women to theological education.\par Congress acknowledged that theological education must take\par far more seriously the contributions and perspectives of women.\par }{\b\fs28 REPORT OF THE FIRST WORLD CONGRESS\par }{\f0 Their partnership within the theological enterprise will challenge\par many established ways of doing theology, as they bring\par distinctive concerns and methodologies to bear upon the theological\par task. WOCATI¹s commitment to having equal representation\par of men and women from member associations at the\par Congress greatly assisted in establishing a positive dynamic\par partnership within the life of the Congress itself. The importance\par of the contributions of women to theological education\par forms one of the continuing areas of study in WOCATI¹s\par programme over the next four years.\par (d) Other issues were related to the ways theological educators\par were pursuing their vocation in a wide range of contexts.\par It was here, as elsewhere, that one of WOCATI¹s unique\par contributions to theological education was experienced, in that\par WOCATI provides the opportunity for dialogue between theological\par educators from all regions of the world. Delegates\par received reports from their colleagues about such issues as:\par (i) the ecumenical nature of theological education;\par (ii) the challenge for faculty members to be involved\par within the struggles of the people;\par (iii) the need for faculty development;\par (iv) difficulties encountered in evaluating credentials\par of various associations;\par (v) encouraging theology and theological education to\par be expressed in indigenous languages;\par (vi) the need to develop more adequate library resources.\par The Congress elected a new executive committee with Dr.\par Yeow Choo Lak as President. It charged the executive committee\par with the responsibility of furthering the aims and\par purposes of WOCATI in a number of ways, as outlined\par elsewhere in this newsletter. It also resolved that the next\par World Congress would be held in 1996.\par }{\i\f0 Ian S.

Lack of space does not allow\par us to print the entire address. What follows presents the main\par points in the first two thirds of the address, combined with the\par complete text of the last sections of the address.\par }{\b Summary\par }{\i\f0 Robert Schreiter was asked to address the question of\par contextualization from a world perspective. His speech began\par with four assumptions behind his approach to contextualization\par which come from his identity as a Roman Catholic: (1) its\par theological appreciation for ³nature² (and therefore culture)\par which especially values oral modes of knowledge, (2) its\par concern for the centrality of the incarnation of Jesus Christ\par which carries hope about all of creation, (3) its sacramental\par view of the world which appreciates nature as conveying\par Divine revelation, and (4) its concern for the ³evangelization\par of cultures,² which goes beyond evangelizing individuals.\par Schreiter examined contextualization:\par 1. Contextualization from a world perspective becomes\par essential because of the inevitability of globalization.\par Contextualization is finding one¹s own voice against the backdrop\par of global media. It is a way of holding up what is noble\par and immensely human and humane in local culture‹against\par all forces that would undermine its dignity.\par 2. Contextualization and globalization are interdependent.\par Thinking about context begins when the larger, global\par reality impinges uncomfortably. At the same time, our concepts\par of globalization have implications for what we do in our\par own locales. The two can serve as mutual correctives as we\par measure our faithfulness and our growth in our educational\par settings.\par 3. Globalization is currently profoundly asymmetrical.\par We are moving from an East-West axis to a North-South\par interaction. In this new world the North does not look to the\par South as a partner, but as a resource to be exploited. In this\par new world the population of the South is expanding and the\par average age of the North is growing older. New patterns of\par mission and dependency are emerging, but it is difficult to\par know the meaning of mutuality in such a profoundly unbalanced\par situation.\par By Robert J. Schreiter\par Professor, Catholic Theological Union, Chicago, Illinois, USA\par 4. Contextualization is coming about more slowly than\par globalization. Why? Because the legacy of colonialism is still\par very strong. The power of the global media culture is pervasive.\par The North resists contextualization because it is felt to be\par a rejection of Northern values. The North resists\par contextualization because it simply does not like to do things\par differently.\par In this situation, according to Schreiter, there are three\par concrete issues facing contextualization‹the uprooting of\par peoples, the question of reception (or how the Gospel message\par is received), and the shape of belonging in multiple worlds of\par reference. He reflects upon the implications of population\par movements for contextualization. He examines issues surrounding\par the way the Gospel is offered and accepted in\par different contexts. And he notes that it is common for people\par to find themselves with double and even triple religious and\par cultural loyalties. In this complex situation it is important to\par understand globalization. The final sections of his address\par examine globalization and the implications of globalization\par and contextualization for theological education. The exact text\par follows:\par }{\b Globalization: The Long View\par }{\f0 Along with our understanding of contextualization, we\par need a fuller understanding of globalization. I wish to sketch\par out a proposal here of how we might understand globalization\par from a perspective useful for theological education and ministry.\par Space does not permit working out the interaction with\par contextualization, except to make some suggestions in the\par closing section.\par I wish to present this perspective on globalization by\par taking a longer view chronologically than we have been wont\par to do in theological education circles. Most frequently, we\par trace the interest in globalization back to the late 1970¹s, just\par as globalization itself is traced back to the early 1960¹s in\par business and education, or to the League of Nations in politics.\par However, I think that blinds us to those ³world² perspectives\par we are hearing from the southern hemisphere. Globalization is\par a phenomenon much larger than theological education‹something\par we all know, but tend to forget. It is larger than the\par phenomenon of religion, although religion plays an important\par role in it.[1]\par }{\b\fs28 CONTEXTUALIZATION FROM A WORLD PERSPECTIVE}\par {\b Page 6 WOCATI News\par }{\f0 To aid in this, I want to make a rough adaption of\par Immanuel Wallerstein¹s world-system theory as a basis for\par understanding globalization.[2] I am proposing that globalization\par (as seen from the point of view of theological education)\par has gone through three stages. Each of these stages is shaped\par by larger developments that serve as the }{\i\f0 carrier }{\f0 of these\par developments; i.e., they form a frame of reference for which\par societies of that time articulate their reality. This articulation,\par in an integrated fashion of all elements of society, creates that\par phase¹s sense of }{\i\f0 universality}{\f0 . Religion in turn responds within\par the carrier to this universality. This is its }{\i\f0 theological mode.\par }{\f0 And this brings about certain }{\i\f0 results }{\f0 that reflect what, at that\par phase, constitutes effective globalization.\par Schemata always distort reality. But they can help us see\par a bigger picture and help us raise questions about what we do,\par and see relationships that may have heretofore eluded us. The\par categories here of carrier, theological mode, universality and\par results are meant heuristically‹not to foreclose, but to make\par us think.\par It should be noted too that each of the three phases\par continues into those of its successors. But as we shall see, what\par happens to the theological modes of the previous phases is that\par they meet a different set of challenges than what they had\par encountered when they were the dominant mode. The phases\par should not be read in an evolutionary pattern form low to\par higher, the world and the carriers of those conditions. Let us\par turn to this long view of globalization.\par }{\b\i\f0 1. First Phase: 1492-1945: Expansion and the building of\par empires.\par }{\f0 The first phase has its period of dominance from the\par European voyages of exploration down to the conclusion of the\par Second World War. It is a time of European expansion and the\par creation of new European territorial space on the other continents\par of the world. The }{\i\f0 carrier }{\f0 of this phase of globalization\par is an image of expansion and establishment of political power\par over wide areas of the world‹empire. The mode of }{\i\f0 universality\par }{\f0 giving justification or credence to this expansion is the\par concept of }{\i\f0 civilization }{\f0 that is invoked. In the early stage, the\par peoples encountered are seen as either animal or demonic; in\par a later stage, as not fully evolved. [3]\par On the religious side, we see a concomitant development,\par reflecting the envelope of the carrier in which it acts, and the\par universality in which it works out its own understanding of\par globalization. Images of expansion of the Church, of a }{\i\f0 plantatio\par ecclesiae }{\f0 come to the fore. There is a sudden interest in\par worldwide evangelization (first among Roman Catholics in\par Spain and Portugal; later among churches of the Reformation\par as England and the Netherlands become worldwide powers).\par The }{\i\f0 theological mode }{\f0 responding to this is }{\i\f0 world mission,\par }{\f0 understood as saving souls and extending the Church. The\par }{\i\f0 results, }{\f0 by the height of European empire building in the\par nineteenth century, is a worldwide missionary movement.\par Globalization, at this point, means extending the message of\par Christ and his church throughout the whole world.\par }{\b\i\f0 2. Second Phase: 1945-1989: Accompaniment, Dialogue,\par Solidarity.\par }{\f0 The Second World War finished what the First World War\par began: the dissolution of the overseas empires of Europe.\par From the late 1940¹s into the 1960¹s, region after region was\par given independence (at least ³flag² independence) and it\par looked as though the shackles of colonialism would be cast off.\par There was an optimism about a new world at that time, fueled\par by economic expansion in the North and a discourse of ³development²\par of the newly formed nations. All of this presaged a\par new kind of world. The }{\i\f0 carrier }{\f0 of this second phase was\par }{\i\f0 decolonialization, independence and economic optimism. }{\f0 The\par mode of universality was }{\i\f0 optimism }{\f0 about overcoming the evils\par of the past.\par On the religious side, Reformation churches found themselves\par overcoming their old antagonisms (partially as a result\par of the student missionary movement and the experience of\par Resistance in Europe during the Second World War), and\par started coming together. The Roman Catholic Church abandoned\par at the official level its fortress mentality against the\par modern world and embraced that same modernity in the\par Second Vatican Council. Both of these Western embodiments\par of Christianity found themselves welcoming a new partnership\par with the churches of the South. The shift into the new phase\par called into question the dominant universalities of the previous\par phase. What ³mission² meant came under close scrutiny.\par Meanwhile, many Catholics and Protestants continued to\par practice mission more or less as they had in the previous phase,\par while others sought modifications, and still others called for\par the outright abandonment of mission.\par The response toward ecumenism, the ambivalence toward\par mission, and a new attention to the churches of the South was\par developed in the carrier envelope of decolonialization, independence\par and optimism. The }{\i\f0 theological modes }{\f0 that emerged\par were those of solidarity, dialogue, and accompaniment. Solidarity\par bespoke the new partnership that led to a sense of\par mutuality and commitment to the churches on the churches¹\par own terms; it gave birth to liberation theologies. Dialogue was\par a reaction to the evangelizing mode of the first phase, and\par emphasized respect for the other and left the possibility of\par conversion deliberately vague. Accompaniment was meant to\par overcome the hegemonic patterns of leadership from the\par colonial period, and replace them with greater mutuality. The}\par {\b February 1993 Page 7\par }{\i\f0 results }{\f0 were a new definition of globalization as ecumenical\par cooperation, interreligious dialogue, and the struggle for justice.\par These were all couched in the optimistic universality of\par the 1960¹s that the world¹s problems could be overcome. The\par tension between mission and these latter three went largely\par unresolved, and for many there was a clear divide between\par mission, on the one hand, and ecumenism, dialogue and justice\par on the other. Many, however, struggled to create a new\par synthesis. Globalization came to embrace all four by the\par 1980¹s.\par }{\b\i\f0 3. Third Phase: 1989 - : Between the Global and the Local.\par }{\f0 Paul Tillich and others said that the twentieth century\par began in August, 1914 with the outbreak of the Great War. It\par could equally be said that it ended with the fall of the Berlin\par Wall. But the conditions leading up to that political event were\par also shaping a larger understanding of what sometimes is\par called the postmodern world. It was 1973, the date of the\par OPEC oil embargo, which is often given as the date when\par economic power and the concomitant modes of production\par began to shift. New technologies, especially in communications,\par marked a move away from largely industrial economies\par to economies involved more in the flow of information, technologies,\par goods and services. Just when the South was struggling\par to attain nation-states, these states were becoming more\par and more superfluous as information and capital drew their\par own map of the world‹one beyond the eighteenth century\par ideal of the nation-state.\par The }{\i\f0 carrier }{\f0 of this new postmodern reality is a new }{\i\f0 global\par capitalism}{\f0 . As was noted earlier, the defeat of socialism left no\par alternative. But the liberal capitalism that had been seen as the\par implacable foe of Marxist socialism has largely disappeared\par now into a new form of capitalism that emphasizes the mobility\par of capital, information and resources rather than the building\par of large industrial bases. While often having a clear national\par identity of origin (Japanese, American, German), it in effect\par moves wherever it needs to in order to achieve its short-range\par goals. Because profit margins have narrowed since the 1960¹s,\par the temptation is to get the short-term profit rather than wait for\par a long-term return. [4] This global capitalism is characterized\par by postnationalism, a communication system built on network\par rather than hierarchy, a multicentered view of the world, and a\par tendency to operate in the short term. While it brings untold\par new wealth to some, it also breeds asymmetries, conflict, and\par a sense of no alternatives for those not included in the flow of\par its information, technology, capital and goods.\par Its mode of }{\i\f0 universality }{\f0 is the new }{\i\f0 global culture, }{\f0 characterized\par by American cola drinks, athletic and casual clothing,\par and American movie and television entertainment. It is a\par culture sent virtually everywhere, but received in considerably\par different fashions. For example, ³Dynasty² is watched differently\par in Lagos than in Los Angeles; studies have shown that\par Canadians see the resolutions of disputes in ³All in the Family²\par differently from the Dutch (Archie tends to be the winner in\par Canada, while Edith, Gloria and Meathead triumph in the\par Netherlands). The universality is both real and unreal at the\par same time. It is real inasmuch as it is found everywhere; it is\par unreal in that what it signifies means different things in the\par reception of the local culture.\par What becomes the theological }{\i\f0 mode }{\f0 of the third phase of\par globalization? Discussions of the meaning of mission continue.\par Worries about the stagnation of ecumenism; the possibility\par of genuine dialogue with the religiously other and a\par theology of religions; and speculation about the future of\par liberation theology in a no-alternative world bespeak the fact\par that even as we have moved into a new phase, the previously\par dominant modes continue with us. After all, most Christians\par still feel the need to spread the Gospel, overcome the scandalous\par divisions in the body of Christ, understand other religious\par traditions better, and struggle for justice. But the optimism that\par marked those earlier discussions has been replaced by a sobered\par realism (the attitude of the postmodern phase). Can a\par new mode be identified?\par I would suggest that the new }{\i\f0 mode }{\f0 will involve bridgebuilding,\par finding symbols of hope, and seeking paths of reconciliation.\par In other words, the barriers in the third phase are not\par between Empire and colony, or between older and younger\par church, but rather they are barriers that run helter-skelter\par through our communities, created by attempts to hold the\par global and the local in critical correlation. Even to phrase it as\par between North and South is too simple, since the South lives\par in the North and the North in the South. We need to find the\par cracks yawning in our midst where the global and the local fail\par to connect. We need to seek symbols of hope in a world that\par seems less and less able to hold out opportunities for another\par vision. Our hope is not the optimistic hope of the 1960¹s; it is\par a tempered, more sobered hope, but a hope nonetheless.\par Likewise, in the tensions and conflicts that emerge, we need to\par seek paths of reconciliation lest an ecologically threatened\par earth fracture altogether. There are many false paths of\par reconciliation, to be sure. But in an ever violent world where\par the majority suffer, reconciliation‹the discovery of the gift of\par true humanity‹is something we cannot disdain to seek. [5]}\par {\b Page 8 WOCATI News\par }{\f0 Globalization in this third phase, then, becomes a quest for\par the bridges between the global and the local. The global has\par changed; its economic face appears to be even less benign than\par in the recent past. This has prompted new expressions of the\par local‹the eruptions in Central Asia and in Eastern Europe, the\par resurgence of native pride in the Americas, but also the\par rootlessness of much of affluent North America and Western\par Europe. How shall the global and the local be configured to one\par another, within communities and across continents? How shall\par prophetic challenge be maintained? If the hypothesis about the\par yoking together of the global and the local suggested above is\par correct, this could well be the shape that globalization will take\par in the ensuing period, even as we struggle to integrate the\par understandings of the first and second phase.\par }{\b Implications for Theological Education\par }{\f0 Let me conclude this already too long presentation with\par just a couple of suggestions about what all of this means for\par theological education today. I make the suggestions in three\par points and a concluding remark about vision.\par If the next phase of globalization finds us between the\par global and the local, we need to prepare ourselves and our\par students to:\par 1. }{\i\f0 Understand the contextual. }{\f0 Especially for uprooted\par peoples, for those who receive in a different way from how it\par is given, and who seek ways (and it is often plural) to belong.\par The world has shifted such that we can no longer presume (or\par perhaps should even presume) an Archimedean point.\par 2. }{\i\f0 Build strong local communities}{\f0 . Only communities\par confident of themselves and imbued with the Gospel will resist\par the temptation to become enclaves or fortresses rather than the\par communities Christ intends.\par 3. }{\i\f0 Interpret the global, }{\f0 both in its hegemonies‹how it\par destroys human life; and in its gifts of decentralization, democratization\par and local empowerment.\par To carry these out in the concrete may require some axial\par changes. The sin-and-forgiveness model that has dominated\par Western Christianity for some many centuries may need to\par give way to others.

But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off\par have been brought near by the blood of Christ.

This requirement has resulted in my presence in this\par conference. Thank you!\par In addressing the question as proposed: }{\i\f0 What are the most\par significant factors, conditions, forces, or developments that\par either positively or negatively affect the role and status of\par women in theological education? }{\f0 my immediate reaction is\par that women are not concerned with their }{\i\f0 role }{\f0 or }{\i\f0 status}{\f0 . What\par is of primary consideration for women is the significance of our\par contribution to the task of theological education.\par One obvious fruit that we would hope for from our\par contribution to this panel is that there might be a greater\par awareness of the distinctive insights that women¹s scholarship\par offers to the world of Christian theology. An example of\par women¹s influence is in regard to methodology. In order to\par prepare for this panel, we gathered together with other women\par here, all of whom were prepared to share their insights.\par Although the daily schedule was crowded, they were still\par willing to give their free time to this purpose. We also chose a\par different physical setting, because we believe that every aspect\par of the experiene of learning is significant. So we chose to\par arrange the group in a circle and to try to operate in a conversational\par manner rather than for each to offer her own isolated\par insights.\par Conversion seems more linked to conversation than to\par dogmatic statement. So, collegiality and collaboration are\par characteristics of the way women engage in theology as a\par community of searchers. Independent and privatised learning\par are not characteristic of women¹s way of knowing--whatever\par the discipline may be. Concrete examples of this can be seen in\par a number of women¹s theological books, but particularly in the\par book edited by Mercy Amba Oduyoye and Musimbi Kanyoro,\par }{\i\f0 The Will to Arise: Women, Tradition and the Church in Africa}{\f0 .\par This book is the outcome of a meeting with African women\par theologians, their sharing about ³the life and dreams, the\par sorrows and joys of African women in a continent where\par religion shapes the whole of life.²\par While men describe the spiritual life in terms of the ³quest\par for the Grail,² with all the individuality of such a personal quest\par as a consequence, women are meeting in groups, such as that\par of the African women, addressing issues related to bonding in\par community. The relational aspects of the faith experience are\par of greater significance to women than the achievements of the\par individual. The group is the focus of consideration rather than\par one¹s own personalised efforts and accomplishments. Women\par are listening with attentiveness to each other, and the bonding\par goes beyond boundaries and ideological differences to deeper\par areas of woman¹s consciousness.\par Among the most critical contributions of women¹s theology\par to the Christian world is its reclaiming of the body.\par Women¹s theology is an embodied spirituality. Much of the\par Christian heritage describes people at war with their bodies.\par Women then become the enemy in men¹s struggle to address\par their sexuality in the spiritual life. At best men are ambivalent\par towards women, in fact if not in theory. The Christian tradition\par gives classic examples of this ambivalence, in both theory and\par practice. Women are usually either idealised by men, or seen\par as a source of temptation.\par Women are concerned to befriend their bodies, to be more\par in tune with them. Their concern is to integrate an embodied\par spirituality, rather than to accept the dualistic heritage that has\par been theirs. So women¹s theology is rich in imagery and\par language that affirms the wholeness of humanity. Metaphors\par that celebrate birth, the feminine experience, and the life of\par passion and compassion abound in women¹s writing. Desire is\par seen as an important aspect in theological writing, as thirst for\par God takes shape within the affective dimension rather than the\par exclusively rational domain.\par With a greater appreciation of the feminine, new images\par and metaphors for God are being generated. This is not simply\par an awareness of God as mother, but there is an increasing\par appreciation of a wide range of biblical descriptions of the\par attributes of God which transcend some of the more limiting\par depictions handed on by nineteenth-century spirituality.\par New insights on sin and grace are resulting from women¹s\par reflection on their own experiences. After listening for years to\par sermons on pride as a primary source of sinfulness, women are\par beginning to realise that a far greater problem for them is selfeffacement\par ‹self-forgetfulness‹because they are so oriented\par towards the needs of others. As women and men dialogue\par about their human experience a deeper awareness of the\par diverse aspects of their Christian spirituality will be a consequence.\par The resulting insights will enrich the faith journeys of\par women and men of all ages and backgrounds.}\par {\b Page 10 WOCATI News\par }{\f0 As women and men become more sensitised to their\par attitudes to those who are ³other² they become more fully\par human. Women have been ³other² in a male-normative culture\par which has been oppressive to women as other, but also to those\par men who did not fit the norm as prescribed by their culture. The\par gift of women to the endeavour to become more fully human,\par more fully ³alive in Christ² is in raising people¹s awareness to\par inner prejudices and bias for whatever cause: sex, race, age,\par social status, or lifestyle. A Christian theology which arises out\par of this heightened sensitivity will be more authentically\par incarnational. The reduction of theology to a system of thought\par which maintains an oppressive status quo has hindered the\par Christian churches for far too long. Exclusiveness and elitism\par within Christianity are always an aberration.\par Finally, women¹s theologising is focused on the future.\par While Christian feminist theology has its roots in its heritage,\par it is not confined to the past. It reaches to the source of light and\par life. It affirms the future in faith, hope and in a loving embrace\par of humanity and the cosmos. Women and men are presently\par working together in creative ways as they respond to the\par challenges of the future in a world that is often described as\par paralysed by fears of nuclear catastrophe. The collaborative\par efforts of women and men who include an authentic feminine\par as a basis of their theological praxis give witness to a vital\par affirmation of covenantal promise. Institutional churches will\par ignore these future-oriented theological activities at their own\par peril. They may find themselves reduced to the circumstances\par of a museum of treasures from the past with little to say to the\par future, or to the identity of a ³dinosaur farm² with benevolent\par creatures whose reality is not related to the present. Women\par have been incredibly patient in the past; they are now realising\par that they have a serious responsibility to make their own unique\par contribution to a future which takes humankind and the created\par world as seriously as their God intended them to take it.\par This conference has acknowledged women¹s contribution\par to theological education. As women we have responded with\par passion and conviction about the importance of this contribution;\par we offer our support and invite WOCATI to continue\par these efforts in the transformation of our world.\par Good and gracious God, we offer thanksgiving for women\par in the life and tradition of the churches.\par We remember the women at the foot of the cross and at the\par Easter tomb.\par We are thankful that they did not flee with the\par other disciples, that they came to care for Jesus\par without knowing who would roll the stone away.\par We remember the women in the early church who spoke up\par when it was not expected of women.\par We are thankful that they refused to remain silent,\par that they reminded the young church that there is\par neither slave nor free, male nor female‹\par but that all are one in Christ Jesus.\par We remember the women who founded religious orders to\par enable women to serve and pray in the church unlimited by\par male powers and rules.\par We are thankful that they found their way to teach\par and heal the young and the poor in need of your\par grace. We will never know all that they have\par done‹but we rest in the fact that your wisdom\par guides and sustains faithful living.\par We remember the women who have challenged authorities\par and principalities in the name of your Holy Spirit.\par We are thankful for their courage even when they\par were burned at the stake, tortured as witches and\par otherwise discounted by those who feared their\par wisdom.\par We remember the women who enroll in formal educational\par programs where they are not welcomed.\par We are thankful that these women call us to\par redefine theological education\par to expand old patterns with the rich stories\par of women\par to change past practices with the methods\par of women\par to explore the possibility that you, our\par God, }{\i\f0 are }{\f0 doing a new thing.\par Thank you God\par -open us to grow and lead your institutions and associations\par in new paths\par -remind us that we dare not rest until all of your servants,\par your young men and your young women,\par can see visions and prophesy in your name.\par Praise be to you our God.

It was concluded that\par there is no immediate need for an Executive Secretary, or for\par special office space in Pittsburgh. The elected secretarytreasurer,\par who is from ATS, can get needed support through\par ATS office staff and volunteers. It was agreed, however, that\par because of this important relationship to ATS, Jim Waits,\par Executive Director of ATS, should attend WOCATI Executive\par Committee meetings as an Advisor.\par It was agreed that the Executive Committee meetings will\par involve:\par € Three officers and four members at large.\par € Three representative ³consultants²\par 1) from WCC - Ecumenical Theological Education.\par 2) from the Vatican/Roman Catholic theological\par education office.\par 3) from ICAA.\par € Two ³advisors²\par 1) James Waits (to assist WOCATI in relation to\par financial resources).\par 2) Petros Vassiliadis (to assist WOCATI in its\par relationships to Orthodox theological education).\par It is understood that WOCATI will pay the expenses for\par the attendance of the ICAA representative and the Orthodox\par advisor. All others will come to the meetings at their own\par expense, unless arrangements for expenses are negotiated with\par the secretary-treasurer before the meeting. Members of the\par working groups asked to come to the April 1994 meetings will\par have their expenses covered by WOCATI.\par It was agreed that only the names of the Executive Committee\par will appear on the stationery. The official mailing\par address of WOCATI will be the home association of the\par secretary-treasurer. In this case it will be 10 Summit Drive,\par Pittsburgh, PA 15275-1103 USA.\par }{\b Finances\par }{\f0 The Executive Committee recognizes that the future of\par WOCATI can never be self-supporting through dues. The\par Executive Committee further recognizes that more diversified\par funding sources (beyond the USA) need to be found to ensure\par the existence of WOCATI after CONGRESS 1996. Therefore\par a small Financial Resources Committee was created to oversee\par the development of funding for WOCATI. Two types of\par funding will be sought: (1) ongoing WOCATI maintenance\par funding, and (2) special travel funding to get specific individuals\par or association representatives to meetings. Strategic planning\par will be done to approach the appropriate sources for both\par types of funding. At present grants to WOCATI from the Lilly\par Endowment Inc., the Luce Foundation and The Pew Charitable\par Trusts provide adequate funding through 1996.\par It was agreed that WOCATI will open a Citibank account\par in New York, NY (USA). Many major banks throughout the\par world can transfer funds into and out of such accounts. This\par account will serve as a clearinghouse for WOCATI, receiving\par dues and paying reimbursements. The business officer of ATS\par will continue to handle daily accounts and keep the records.\par }{\b\i\f0 WOCATI News\par }{\f0 WOCATI will publish a newsletter once or twice a year.\par The editor will be the secretary-treasurer and it will be called\par the }{\i\f0 WOCATI NEWS}{\f0 . ATS will assist in the design, production\par and mailing of }{\i\f0 WOCATI NEWS }{\f0 as an in-kind contribution.\par WOCATI will cover direct costs (printing and mailing).\par The newsletter will list the names of member associations,\par showing which associations have paid dues ³at the time of\par printing.² This practice will apply subtle pressure on associations\par to pay dues. Where there are real currency/exchange\par problems, however, member associations will not be embarrassed.\par The entire newsletter will be printed in English. Although\par printing some articles in other languages might be\par convenient to some of the membership, it is impossible to do\par that without offending others. It is more equitable to print all\par of the newsletter in English.\par The best distribution system is to mail the newsletter\par directly to all institutions which belong to member associations.\par If an association supplies WOCATI with addresses for\par member institutions the newsletter will be mailed directly.\par Otherwise bulk mail packets of 20-25 copies will be mailed to\par each member association for distribution regionally.\par }{\i\f0 Barbara Brown Zikmund, Secretary-Treasurer, USA\par }{\b NOTICE TO ASSOCIATIONS\par }{\f0 We will be happy to mail copies of }{\i\f0 WOCATI News\par }{\f0 directly to each of your member institutions if you will\par send the addresses to: }{\i\f0 WOCATI News, }{\f0 10 Summit Park\par Drive, Pittsburgh, PA 15275-1103, USA.\par }{\b Page 12\par}\par } 
