# World Conference of Associations of Theological Institutions (WOCATI) Theological Education Network
# Constitution and Bylaws


## CONSTITUTION

### 1\. PREAMBLE

*   1.1. Theological education is a worldwide enterprise fundamental to the mission of the church. In its most immediate and concrete forms, theological education is shaped by the religious, educational, social, political, and historical traditions within which it exists. Theological education is carried out in a world which is increasingly aware of its interdependence and religious plurality. Its context is both local and global and therefore, it can function more effectively within a worldwide framework.
*   1.2. These characteristics of theological education have led theological institutions to commit themselves to closer cooperation at local, national, and regional levels. In the late 80s, due to initiatives in the Ecumenical Theological Education (ETE) of the WCC, it was seen as appropriate that a global network and organization be established to serve, support, and enhance theological education in its constituent parts. To this end, in 1989 the World Conference of Associations of Theological Institutions (WOCATI) was established and held its inaugural meeting at Kaliurang, Yogyakarta, Indonesia, 19th June, 1989. The members constituting WOCATI join themselves together for the purpose of advancing their shared vision, purpose, and common cause.
*   1.3. There is a special and historic relationship between WOCATI and the program on Ecumenical Theological Education (ETE) of the WCC. Both the global network of accrediting institutions of theological education and the global programme on ecumenical theological education complement and need each other, though neither can do the job of the other.
