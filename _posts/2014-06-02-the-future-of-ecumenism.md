In 2013 the World Council of Churches had it's 10th general assembly and WOCATI was one of many participants in this adventure. Here is a video by Candice Eloby, chronicling the Global Ecumenical Theological Institute program. [GETI](http://www.globethics.net/web/gtl/ "GETI") was an wonderful initiative that brought together 150 student-theologians from around the world to meet and work with a top notch faculty, which had several WOCATI members, and so that these students could experience ecumenism at its best.
